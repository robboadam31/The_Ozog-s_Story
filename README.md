# The_Ozogs_Story

My Grandad was born and raised in Poland, and grew up during the Nazi occupation of Poland from 1939-1945. He wrote a short novel about his experience and the family, which was only discovered on his computer when he passed away in 2012.

It's currently a Word document, but I'm trying to get it into an .EPUB format so that we can read it more accessibly on Kindles/iPads etc.

This is a really important project for me and my family, but I'm struggling to get it into this format. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
